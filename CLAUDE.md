# myxray

A **Cloudflare Python Worker** that hands an Xray client (e.g. the **Hiddify**
Android app) a ready-to-use connection URL. Given a PIN, it selects a server,
finds (and if needed boots) that server's AWS EC2 VM tagged `Name=xray`, grabs
the public IP, and builds an Xray (VLESS + REALITY) share URL.

It runs on the [Python Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/)
runtime (Pyodide) and is managed with **`pywrangler`** (the `uv`-first CLI from
the `workers-py` package).

## What it does

The PIN lives in the **URL path**, and the path also selects the output:

```
GET  https://xsubs.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/2580        # plain-text share URL
GET  https://xsubs.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/2580/qr     # HTML QR page (+ Start button)
POST https://xsubs.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/2580/boot   # start a stopped VM (async)
```

Every route first **validates the `pin`** (the first path segment): it selects a
server profile, fetched from the `XRAY_KV` namespace at key `pin:<PIN>` (a single
KV read) — its AWS region, Xray UUID, REALITY public key + short id, and display
name. Unknown PINs are rejected with `403`.

### Routes

| Route | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `GET /<pin>` | **Subscription / plain-URL endpoint.** Resolves the `Name=xray` VM in the profile's region. **Running** → builds the `vless://…` share URL (public IP + the profile's Xray credentials + common params from `config.SNI`/`config.XRAY_PORT`/…) and returns it as `text/plain`. **Not running / absent** → `404`. **Never boots the VM** — so a routine subscription refresh can't wake (and bill) a stopped instance. |
| `GET /<pin>/qr` | **QR page.** VM **running** → a self-contained HTML page with the share URL rendered as a scannable QR code (inline SVG, generated server-side). VM **not running** → an HTML page with a **Start** button: pressing it `POST`s to `/<pin>/boot`, then polls `GET /<pin>` until the VM is ready and reloads to show the QR. |
| `POST /<pin>/boot` | **Boot a stopped VM.** Fires `StartInstances` (if the VM is stopped) and returns **immediately** (`202 {"state":"pending"}`) — it does *not* wait for the IP. The waiting/polling happens client-side on the QR page. A running VM returns `200 {"state":"running"}`. |

Booting is therefore **opt-in and interactive** (the QR page's button → `POST
/boot`), never a side effect of fetching a subscription.

### PINs → servers

Each PIN maps to a full server profile (region, UUID, REALITY public key, short
id, name) stored as a JSON value at key `pin:<PIN>` in the `XRAY_KV` namespace,
populated by `scripts/xray.py new`. Keeping profiles in KV (rather than a
committed `servers.py`) keeps the per-server Xray credentials out of the git
repo. (None are provisioned right now.)

> KV is not encrypted-secret storage — values are readable by anyone with
> Cloudflare account access (the AWS keys are still kept as encrypted Worker
> *secrets*). The win here is that `uuid`/`sid` no longer live in source control.

### Responses

All responses are sent `Cache-Control: no-store` (the IP changes on VM reboot).

| Status | When |
|--------|------|
| `200`  | `GET /<pin>`: plain-text `vless://…` URL · `GET /<pin>/qr`: HTML (QR or Start page) · `POST /<pin>/boot`: `{"state":"running"}` |
| `202`  | `POST /<pin>/boot`: `StartInstances` fired (or VM already booting) — `{"state":"pending"}` |
| `400`  | Missing `pin` in the path |
| `403`  | Unknown `pin` |
| `404`  | Unknown route/action, wrong VM, or (on `GET /<pin>`) no running `xray` VM in the profile's region |
| `405`  | Wrong HTTP method for the route (e.g. `GET /<pin>/boot`, or `POST /<pin>`) |
| `500`  | Missing AWS credentials / unexpected error |
| `502`  | EC2 API error |

---

## How it's built

- **No `boto3`.** boto3 needs raw sockets and does not run in a Worker. Instead
  the Worker signs EC2 **Query API** requests with **AWS SigV4** implemented in
  the standard library (`src/sigv4.py`) and sends them via the JavaScript
  `fetch` interop (`src/aws_ec2.py`). XML responses are parsed with
  `xml.etree.ElementTree`.
- **One small runtime dependency** — `segno` (pure Python, dependency-free) for
  the QR page. The core path (EC2 lookup + SigV4) is stdlib + `fetch` only. QR
  codes are generated server-side as an inline SVG, so the share URL (which
  contains the user's UUID) is never sent to a third-party QR service.

## Prerequisites

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed.
- **Node 22 LTS** (or 20). `pywrangler`/Pyodide require it; **Node 23+ breaks the
  build** with `node: bad option: --experimental-wasm-stack-switching`. Install
  and pin it with Homebrew:
  ```bash
  brew install node@22 && brew link --overwrite node@22
  node --version            # must print v22.x
  ```
- A Cloudflare account (`pywrangler` will prompt you to log in on first deploy).
- AWS IAM credentials able to describe EC2 + VPC and start/stop/terminate/run
  instances (`scripts/aws_role.sh` provisions a least-privilege `xray-ops` user
  with exactly this).

`pywrangler` comes from the `workers-py` dev dependency in `pyproject.toml`, so
you run it through `uv run` — no global install needed. `uv` fetches it on first
use. (To bootstrap a brand-new project you'd use
`uvx --from workers-py pywrangler init`, but this repo is already scaffolded.)

> `pywrangler` is a wrapper around `wrangler`: it uses `uv` to install
> Python-Worker-compatible dependencies and `wrangler` to run/deploy.

---

## Configure before first deploy

1. **KV namespace** — create the namespace that holds the per-server profiles
   and paste its id into `wrangler.jsonc` (the `kv_namespaces` binding `XRAY_KV`):

   ```bash
   uv run pywrangler kv namespace create XRAY_KV   # prints { id = "..." }
   ```

   Then add servers with `scripts/xray.py new` (it writes `pin:<PIN>` keys
   into this namespace — see "Create a new Xray server"). No `PIN_PROFILES` in
   source anymore.
2. **Common Xray params** — set `SNI`, `FINGERPRINT`, `XRAY_PORT` in
   `src/config.py` (shared by every server).
3. **AWS credentials.** Create the `xray-ops` IAM user and a verified access key
   with the helper script (see below), or bring your own. Then store them.

   Keep the creds in a **git-ignored `.secrets`** file (format `KEY=VALUE`):

   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
   # AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=...   # only for temporary STS credentials
   ```

   This file is just a local source for the credentials — the deployed Worker's
   real secrets live encrypted **on Cloudflare**, not in any file. Upload them
   once (they persist across every future deploy):

   ```bash
   uv run pywrangler secret bulk .secrets        # uploads every KEY=VALUE
   # or one at a time, interactively:
   uv run pywrangler secret put AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   ```

   `.secrets` is git-ignored; commit `.secrets.example` (placeholders only) as
   documentation. (For an occasional local run, `uv run pywrangler dev
   --env-file .secrets`; without `--env-file`, `pywrangler dev` only auto-loads
   a file literally named `.dev.vars` — wrangler's local-dev convention.)

### Create the IAM user (`scripts/aws_role.sh`)

Creates/updates the least-privilege `xray-ops` IAM user, mints an access key, and
verifies it. Permissions granted:
- **Read**: EC2 describe + VPC lookups (subnets / route-tables / internet-gateways)
  — used to find an internet-facing subnet when provisioning.
- **Manage** (scoped to instances tagged `Name=xray`): start / stop / terminate /
  modify-attribute (e.g. to disable termination protection before deleting).
- **Provision**: `RunInstances`, create/authorize the `xray-sg` security group,
  and tag-on-create. (No key pairs — the SSH key is authorized via cloud-init.)

It then dry-runs Start / Run / Terminate (nothing is actually changed):

```bash
./scripts/aws_role.sh                          # region from your AWS config
USER_NAME=xray-ops REGION=us-west-2 ./scripts/aws_role.sh
```

Requires an AWS CLI identity allowed to manage IAM. Paste the printed key/secret
into `.secrets`, then `secret bulk` it as above.

---

## Deploy

> **Requires Node 22** active (Node 23+ breaks the Pyodide build). Check with
> `node --version`; if it's not v22.x:
> `brew install node@22 && brew link --overwrite node@22`.

First-time deploy:

```bash
# 0. confirm the toolchain
node --version                          # v22.x (or v20.x)

# 1. configure src/config.py + .secrets   (see "Configure before first deploy")

# 2. log in to Cloudflare (one-time, opens a browser)
uv run pywrangler login

# 3. create the KV namespace for profiles, then paste its id into wrangler.jsonc
#    (kv_namespaces -> binding XRAY_KV). One-time.
uv run pywrangler kv namespace create XRAY_KV

# 4. upload AWS secrets to Cloudflare (one-time; persists across deploys)
uv run pywrangler secret bulk .secrets

# 5. deploy — output prints the live URL, e.g. https://xsubs.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
uv run pywrangler deploy

# 6. provision a server (writes its profile into KV), then verify
uv run scripts/xray.py new --region us-west-2 --name US
curl "https://xsubs.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/<printed-pin>"
```

**Redeploy** after any code/config change is just `uv run pywrangler deploy` —
secrets and the workers.dev URL persist, so steps 2–3 are one-time only. Preview
a build without publishing with `uv run pywrangler deploy --dry-run`.

---

## Commands

```bash
# Run locally (http://localhost:8787) with hot reload  (also needs Node 22)
uv run pywrangler dev

# Try it
curl "http://localhost:8787/2580"

# Deploy to Cloudflare
uv run pywrangler deploy

# Generate type hints for the Workers runtime (optional, for editor support)
uv run pywrangler types

# Tail live logs from the deployed Worker
uv run pywrangler tail
```

After `uv run pywrangler deploy`, the Worker is reachable at
`https://xsubs.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/<pin>`.

### Custom domain (optional — currently disabled)

The Worker is served on its **workers.dev URL** (`"workers_dev": true`), so no DNS
is required. If you additionally want a custom hostname like `xsubs.vino9.net`,
uncomment the `routes` block in `wrangler.jsonc` and create the DNS record below.
A route binds the Worker to a hostname via a DNS record in the (Cloudflare-hosted)
`vino9.net` zone:

```jsonc
"routes": [
  { "pattern": "xsubs.vino9.net/*", "zone_name": "vino9.net" }
]
```

**Step 1 — create the proxied DNS record** (Cloudflare dashboard → `vino9.net` →
DNS → Records → *Add record*):

| Field   | Value                                              |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Type    | `AAAA` (or `A`)                                     |
| Name    | `xsubs`                                             |
| IPv6/IP | `100::` for AAAA (or `192.0.2.1` for A) — a placeholder; the proxy intercepts the request before any origin is reached |
| Proxy   | **Proxied (orange cloud)** — required; DNS-only (grey) will NOT route to the Worker |
| TTL     | Auto                                               |

The record's address is irrelevant because a proxied request bound to a Worker
route is handled by the Worker and never forwarded to that address. Cloudflare
provisions TLS for the hostname automatically.

**Step 2 — deploy** so the route attaches:

```bash
uv run pywrangler deploy
```

It then answers at `https://xsubs.vino9.net/2580`.

> If the route doesn't take effect, the usual cause is the DNS record being set
> to **DNS-only (grey cloud)** — toggle it to **Proxied**.

---

## Common tasks (runbook)

Step-by-step for the things you'll actually do. All commands run from the repo
root. Deploys need **Node 22** on `PATH` (Node 23+ breaks the Pyodide build):

```bash
node --version            # must be v22.x (or v20.x); if not:
brew install node@22 && brew link --overwrite node@22
```

### Deploy / redeploy after a code or config change

```bash
uv run pywrangler deploy
```

Secrets and routes persist; you only re-run `deploy`. To preview the build
without publishing, add `--dry-run`.

### Change the custom domain / subdomain

1. Edit the `routes` pattern in `wrangler.jsonc`, e.g.
   `{ "pattern": "<new-host>.vino9.net/*", "zone_name": "vino9.net" }`.
2. In the Cloudflare dashboard, add a **Proxied (orange-cloud)** DNS record for
   the new host (`AAAA` → `100::`), per the *Custom domain* section above.
3. `uv run pywrangler deploy` — wrangler attaches the new route and drops the
   old one. Delete the old host's DNS record in the dashboard.

### Manage Xray servers (`scripts/xray.py`)

One tool covers the whole lifecycle, one VM per region (tagged `Name=xray`):

```
uv run scripts/xray.py new    --region <region> --name <Label> [--pin <pin>]
uv run scripts/xray.py status (--region <region> | --name <Label> | --pin <pin>)
uv run scripts/xray.py start  (--region <region> | --name <Label> | --pin <pin>)
uv run scripts/xray.py stop   (--region <region> | --name <Label> | --pin <pin>)
uv run scripts/xray.py delete (--region <region> | --name <Label> | --pin <pin>) [--yes]
```

**AWS is the source of truth; Cloudflare KV is an optional convenience layer.**
The VM is always found by its `Name=xray` tag, so **`--region` works without
KV**. `--name` / `--pin` are KV-backed aliases for a region (KV is the only place
that maps them), so they **require KV** — if KV is unreachable the command tells
you to select with `--region` instead. AWS creds come from `.secrets` (xray-ops)
via python-dotenv; KV access reuses your `pywrangler login`. All ops accept
`--dry-run` except `status` (which is read-only); `new`/`delete` accept `--yes`.

> The script prints ready-to-run `curl` commands using your Worker URL. Since
> this is a public repo, the URL is **not** hard-coded — set it once per shell so
> the printed commands are runnable:
> ```bash
> export XRAY_WORKER_URL="https://xsubs.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev"
> ```
> Without it, the commands show the `<your-subdomain>` placeholder (everything
> else still works).

#### `new` — provision a server

```bash
uv run scripts/xray.py new --region us-west-2      --name US
uv run scripts/xray.py new --region tokyo          --name Tokyo --pin 1470
uv run scripts/xray.py new --region eu-central-1   --name EU --dry-run   # preview
# verify (note the printed PIN; allow ~1-2 min for Xray to finish installing)
curl "https://xsubs.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/<pin>"
```

What it does (no SSH needed for setup):
- Aborts if a `Name=xray` VM already exists in that region (use `status` /
  `start` / `delete` for an existing one).
- Picks the **first existing EC2 key pair** in the region for SSH access (aborts
  if none — create one, and keep its `.pem`, first).
- Finds an internet-facing subnet; creates the **`xray-sg`** security group
  (443 + 22 from anywhere; restrict SSH with `--ssh-cidr`).
- Generates the UUID + REALITY x25519 keypair + short id **locally**, and launches
  a **Debian 13 arm64 `t4g.micro`** whose cloud-init installs Xray, writes
  `config.json` (logs to `/var/log/xray`), and starts the service.
- If KV is reachable: enforces a **unique display name**, then writes the client
  profile (region / uuid / pbk / sid / name) to `pin:<PIN>`. If KV is down it
  still provisions the VM and prints the profile + the `wrangler kv key put`
  command to add it later.

`--pin` is optional (a random 5-digit PIN is generated). Server template /
instance type / SNI etc. are constants near the top of the script — tune
`render_xray_config()` to change the config (keep SNI/PORT/FLOW in sync with
`src/config.py`).

#### `status` / `start` / `stop` / `delete` — manage an existing server

```bash
uv run scripts/xray.py status --region us-west-2     # state + IP (+ PIN if KV up)
uv run scripts/xray.py status --pin 1470             # by PIN (needs KV)
uv run scripts/xray.py start  --name Tokyo           # boot a stopped VM (needs KV)
uv run scripts/xray.py stop   --region us-west-2     # stop a running VM
uv run scripts/xray.py delete --region us-west-2 --yes   # terminate VM + delete KV key
```

- `status` reports the VM's state and public IP; with KV up it also prints the
  PIN and the ready-to-use client URL.
- `start` boots a stopped VM and waits for the (new) public IP. The Worker
  resolves the IP live on every request, so existing client URLs keep working.
- `stop` stops a running VM (saves cost; the IP is released).
- `delete` disables termination protection, terminates the VM, and — when KV is
  reachable — deletes its `pin:<PIN>` key (it derives the PIN from the region if
  you selected by `--region`). This replaces the manual EC2/KV teardown.

#### `export` / `import` — bulk edit profiles as a JSON file

Dump every profile to a single JSON file, edit it by hand, and push it back.
Both need KV (they only touch KV — no AWS). The file is a JSON object keyed by
bare PIN (`export` sorts keys for stable diffs):

```bash
# export all profiles (default: stdout; --out writes a file)
uv run scripts/xray.py export --out servers.json

# ... edit servers.json by hand ...

uv run scripts/xray.py import --in servers.json --dry-run   # preview the changes
uv run scripts/xray.py import --in servers.json             # upsert (writes + confirm)
```

`servers.json` looks like:

```json
{
  "2580": {"region":"us-west-2","name":"US","uuid":"<uuid>","pbk":"<pbk>","sid":"<sid>"},
  "1470": {"region":"ap-northeast-1","name":"Tokyo","uuid":"<uuid>","pbk":"<pbk>","sid":"<sid>"}
}
```

- `import` is an **upsert**: each PIN in the file is written (new ones added,
  existing ones overwritten). PINs already in KV but **absent from the file are
  left alone** unless you pass `--prune` (which deletes them). It validates that
  every profile has `region`, `name`, `uuid`, `pbk`, `sid` before writing
  anything, and `--dry-run` shows the add/update/prune plan without touching KV.
- `servers.json` contains per-server UUIDs — treat it like a secret (don't
  commit it; it's covered by `.secrets`/`*.pem`-style hygiene, add it to
  `.gitignore` if you keep it around).

**Adding a 2nd user to an existing server.** A "user" is an Xray client UUID.
To give a server a second user with its own PIN:

1. Pick a new UUID (e.g. `python3 -c 'import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())'`).
2. **On the VM**, add that UUID to the `clients` array in
   `/usr/local/etc/xray/config.json` (same `flow`), then
   `sudo systemctl restart xray`. (SSH in with the region's EC2 key pair.)
3. **In KV**, add a new entry via export/import: copy the server's existing
   profile to a new PIN, keeping the same `region`/`pbk`/`sid`, and set the new
   `uuid` (and a distinct `name` — names must be unique):

   ```jsonc
   "73218": {"region":"us-west-2","name":"US-alice","uuid":"<new-uuid>","pbk":"<same-pbk>","sid":"<same-sid>"}
   ```

   Then `uv run scripts/xray.py import --in servers.json`. Both PINs now point at
   the same VM, each handing its user a distinct UUID.

> Note: `export`/`import` only manage the KV side (what the Worker hands clients).
> The server's `config.json` (which UUIDs it actually accepts) is edited
> separately over SSH, as in step 2 — they are not kept in sync automatically.

#### Manual KV alternative (no script)

```bash
uv run pywrangler kv key put --binding XRAY_KV --remote pin:2580 \
  '{"region":"us-west-2","name":"US","uuid":"...","pbk":"...","sid":"..."}'
# inspect / remove:
uv run pywrangler kv key list --binding XRAY_KV --remote
uv run pywrangler kv key get  --binding XRAY_KV --remote pin:2580
uv run pywrangler kv key delete --binding XRAY_KV --remote pin:2580
```

### Change the common Xray params (sni / fingerprint / port)

Edit `SNI`, `FINGERPRINT`, or `XRAY_PORT` in `src/config.py` (the per-server
`pbk` / `sid` / `name` live in the `XRAY_KV` namespace). Then `uv run pywrangler
deploy`. The generated URL updates immediately.

### Rotate AWS credentials

```bash
./scripts/aws_role.sh                              # mints + verifies a new key
# paste the printed key/secret into .secrets, then:
uv run pywrangler secret bulk .secrets             # push to Cloudflare
# then delete the OLD key so only the new one is live:
aws iam list-access-keys --user-name xray-ops
aws iam delete-access-key --user-name xray-ops --access-key-id <OLD_ID>
```

(No redeploy needed — secrets update independently of the Worker code.)

### Inspect / debug a live request

```bash
uv run pywrangler tail                                      # stream live logs + errors
curl "https://xsubs.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/<pin>"            # exercise it
```

### Verify the AWS lookup locally (without deploying)

Runs the real signing code against AWS over `urllib` (needs Python ≥3.10):

```bash
python3 scripts/local_lookup.py                     # us-west-2, tag Name=xray
REGION=ap-northeast-1 python3 scripts/local_lookup.py
```

### Roll back to a previous version

```bash
uv run pywrangler deployments list                  # find the prior Version ID
uv run pywrangler rollback [<version-id>]
```

### Tear down

```bash
# 1. delete each server (terminates the VM + removes its KV profile). Repeat per
#    region, or select by --name / --pin. See "Manage Xray servers".
uv run scripts/xray.py delete --region us-west-2 --yes

# 2. remove the Worker + KV namespace + IAM user
uv run pywrangler delete                            # remove the Worker + routes
uv run pywrangler kv namespace list                 # find the XRAY_KV id
uv run pywrangler kv namespace delete --namespace-id <ID>   # remove the profiles
aws iam delete-access-key --user-name xray-ops --access-key-id <ID>
aws iam delete-user-policy --user-name xray-ops --policy-name xray-ops-ec2
aws iam delete-user --user-name xray-ops
```

If you enabled the optional custom domain, also delete its DNS record in the
Cloudflare dashboard (not needed for the workers.dev setup).

---

## Using it from Hiddify (or another Xray client)

There are two main workflows. Pick one (the QR flow is friendliest when the VM
might be stopped, since it can start it for you):

**1. QR page (boot, if needed, then scan).**
Open the QR page in a browser:

```
https://xsubs.<subdomain>.workers.dev/2580/qr
```

- VM **running** → it shows a scannable QR. Open Hiddify (or any Xray client) and
  scan it with the in-app camera to import the config.
- VM **stopped** → it shows a **Start server** button. Press it; the page boots
  the VM, waits for the public IP, then displays the QR — then scan as above.

**2. Subscription URL (paste into the client).**
Open the client and add a *subscription* pointing at the plain endpoint:

```
https://xsubs.<subdomain>.workers.dev/2580

The client re-fetches this on refresh and always gets a fresh IP (the Worker
resolves it live on every request), so the config keeps working across VM
reboots. Note this endpoint **never boots the VM** — if the VM is stopped the
fetch returns `404`; start it first via the QR page's button (or
`scripts/xray.py start`). You can also paste the single `vless://…` line that
this endpoint / `curl` prints directly into the client instead of subscribing.
